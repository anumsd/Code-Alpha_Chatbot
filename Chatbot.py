Hello! How can I help you today?
I am a basic chatbot.
How are you doing today?
I am here to provide valuable information and help you with your tasks.
What are you doing?
I am doing well, thank you for asking.
I was built using Python and NLTK.
I am here to chat with you and assist you.
I can assist with general questions and basic responses.
Sure, I can suggest a few popular fast food places nearby.
Do you want recommendations for fast food?
Can you help me find some fast food places?
You can try McDonald's, KFC, or a local favorite!
I was built by a programmer interested in Python and AI!
I can't dance, but I can make you imagine a great dance in your mind!
Do you want to know the weather today?
I can provide a mock weather report if you're interested.
Would you like to hear some recent news headlines?
I can share a motivational quote with you if you're feeling down.
